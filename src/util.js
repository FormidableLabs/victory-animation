/**
 * By default, `d3.interpolate` (which cycles through a list of interpolators)
 * has a few downsides:
 *
 * - `null` values get turned into 0.
 * - `undefined`, `function`, and some other value types get turned into NaN.
 * - It tries to interpolate between identical start->end values, doing
 *   unnecessary calculations that sometimes result in floating point rounding
 *   errors.
 *
 * If only the default interpolators are used, `VictoryAnimation` will happily
 * pass down NaN (and other bad) values as props to the wrapped component.
 * The component will then either use the incorrect values or complain that it
 * was passed props of the incorrect type. This custom interpolator is added
 * using the `d3.interpolators` API, and prevents such cases from happening
 * for most values.
 *
 * @param {any} a - Start value.
 * @param {any} b - End value.
 * @returns {Function} Returns an interpolation function, if possible.
